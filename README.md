# README Generator

  ## Description
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <br>
  Using node.js and installed inquirer, a preformatted README is generated by answering a few questions in the terminal.  Once all questions are answered, a new README file will be made, where edits to the text can be made as needed.<br>
